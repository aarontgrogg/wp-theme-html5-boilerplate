/*
	Any site-specific scripts you might have.
	Note that <html> innately gets a class of "no-js".
	This is to allow you to react to non-JS users.
	Recommend removing that and adding "js" as one of the first things your script does.
	Note that if you are using Modernizr, it already does this for you. :-)
